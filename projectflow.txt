1-> create git repo and clone it in local
2-> create a code file code.py and code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3-> do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
4-> pip install dvc (if not already there)
5-> now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6-> now do mkdir S3 (this is where the data files will be saved, altho prctically we use real AWS s3 service and use that path, but this is just to learn dvc rn)
7-> Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" (instead of S3 we'd enter the S3 url if we were using s3 service)
8-> next "dvc add data/" (telling dvc that it has to track this entire folder we can also make it track certain files by data/filename)

Adding...                                                                                                                                
ERROR:  output 'data' is already tracked by SCM (e.g. Git).                                                                              
    You can remove it from Git, then add to DVC.
        To stop tracking from Git:
            9-> git rm -r --cached 'data' # command for git to stop tracking /data
            10-> git commit -m "stop tracking data" # commmiting that change
            ->->-> (this is because git is already tracking that folder) <-<-<-
11-> now perform "dvc add data/" again and this time you'll get no ERROR
                        To track the changes with git, run:

                            git add .gitignore data.dvc            (this data.dvc contains the id, its named data.dvc as its tracking the folder named "data" also you'll find the data cached in .dvc folder)

                    To enable auto staging, run:

                            dvc config core.autostage true

12->git add .gitignore data.dvc to track these changes
13-> now do dvc commit and dvc push
14-> now do git add/commit/push to mark this stage as the first version of the data
15-> now we make changes to the mycode.py file to append a new row in data , check changes via "dvc status"
16-> now we do "dvc commit" and "dvc push" # this changes the data.dvc file and the id is changed this data.dvc file is different throught every git version, thus when you rollback to a certain git version you find a data.dvc file contaning the data version id , also all various data verisons are saved in S3 which is usually on some cloud (S3 bucket) so obviously its not traced
16-> now we git add/commit/push
17 -> now make chanegs in the mycode.py to add a new row again to create 3rd version
18-> now again "dvc commit" and "dvc push" this changes the data.dvc file as well as store current version of data in S3
19-> do git add/commit/push to save the 3rd version of the code
20-> git log --oneline
21-> git checkout <hash>
